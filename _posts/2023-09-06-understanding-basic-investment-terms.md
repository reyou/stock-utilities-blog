## Market Capitalization

### What is it?

Market Capitalization, often shortened to 'Market Cap,' refers to the total market value of all a company's outstanding shares of stock. In layman's terms, if a company were a pizza, its market cap would be the price of the whole pizza, not just a single slice.

#### Formula

\[ \text{Market Cap} = \text{Stock Price} \times \text{Number of Outstanding Shares} \]

### How to Interpret it

The market cap can give you a good idea of the company's size and how the market values it. Companies are often categorized as:

1. **Small-Cap**: Less than $2 billion
2. **Mid-Cap**: $2 billion - $10 billion
3. **Large-Cap**: More than $10 billion

### Quick Quote

As Benjamin Graham said, "In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." Market cap is the weighing scale, showing the substance and heft a company has in the marketplace.

## Dividend Yield

### What is it?

The Dividend Yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. Think of it as the interest rate your bank gives you but for owning a company's stock.

#### Formula

\[ \text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividend per Share}}{\text{Stock Price}} \]

### How to Interpret it

A higher Dividend Yield usually suggests that a company shares a more significant portion of its profits with its shareholders. However, this isn't always a sign of stability. Sometimes, a high yield could mean the company is not reinvesting enough in itself.

### Quick Quote

Warren Buffet has been a vocal advocate for companies that provide dividends. He said, "If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes."

## P/E Ratio

### What is it?

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is like the price tag on future earnings. It tells you how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of earnings a company generates.

#### Formula

\[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Earnings Per Share (EPS)}} \]

### How to Interpret it

A higher P/E ratio typically indicates that investors have higher expectations for a company's future growth. Conversely, a lower P/E ratio may suggest the opposite, or that the stock is undervalued.

### Quick Quote

As Peter Lynch once noted, "The P/E ratio of any company that's fairly priced will equal its growth rate."

## EPS (Earnings Per Share)

### What is it?

EPS stands for Earnings Per Share and can be thought of as the portion of a company's profit allocated to each share of stock. Imagine a pie (the company‚Äôs profit) divided into equal slices (each share of stock). The size of one slice is your EPS.

#### Formula

\[ \text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Dividends on Preferred Stock}}{\text{Average Outstanding Shares}} \]

### How to Interpret it

A higher EPS usually indicates better financial health and profitability. Keep an eye on this when picking individual stocks.

## Bonds & Bond Yields

### What is it?

A bond is like an IOU from the government or a corporation. When you buy a bond, you're essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value when it matures.

### How to Interpret it

Bond Yields are the interest rates on bonds. Generally, a higher yield means a riskier bond. Always consider the issuer's creditworthiness.

## Mutual Funds & ETFs

### What is it?

Think of Mutual Funds and ETFs as baskets containing multiple stocks, bonds, or other assets. They're like a pre-made salad at the supermarket: all the ingredients are already mixed in!

### How to Interpret it

Mutual Funds are actively managed, meaning professionals curate and adjust the portfolio. ETFs are usually passively managed, tracking an index or sector. Choose based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
