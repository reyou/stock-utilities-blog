## Market Capitalization

### What is it?

Market Capitalization, often shortened to 'Market Cap,' refers to the total market value of all a company's outstanding shares of stock. In layman's terms, if a company were a pizza, its market cap would be the price of the whole pizza, not just a single slice.

#### Formula

Market Cap = Stock Price x Number of Outstanding Shares

### How to Interpret it

The market cap can give you a good idea of the company's size and how the market values it. Companies are often categorized as:

1. **Small-Cap**: Less than $2 billion
2. **Mid-Cap**: $2 billion - $10 billion
3. **Large-Cap**: More than $10 billion

### Quick Quote

As Benjamin Graham said, "In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." Market cap is the weighing scale, showing the substance and heft a company has in the marketplace.

## Dividend Yield

### What is it?

The Dividend Yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. Think of it as the interest rate your bank gives you but for owning a company's stock.

#### Formula

Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend per Share) / Stock Price

### How to Interpret it

A higher Dividend Yield usually suggests that a company shares a more significant portion of its profits with its shareholders. However, this isn't always a sign of stability. Sometimes, a high yield could mean the company is not reinvesting enough in itself. 

The dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company returns to its shareholders in the form of dividends. A 1.35% dividend yield means that the company pays 1.35% of its stock price as dividends over a year.

In your case, if the stock price is $100, the annual dividend per share would be $100 * 1.35% = $1.35.

If you own 10 shares, you would receive 10 * $1.35 = $13.50 in dividends over a year.

However, the frequency of the dividend payments can vary from company to company. Some companies pay dividends quarterly, some semi-annually, and some annually. You would need to check the company's dividend policy or financial statements to find out how often they pay dividends. If, for example, the company pays dividends quarterly, you would receive $13.50 / 4 = $3.375 four times a year.

### Quick Quote

Warren Buffet has been a vocal advocate for companies that provide dividends. He said, "If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes."

## EPS (Earnings Per Share)

### What is it?

EPS stands for Earnings Per Share and can be thought of as the portion of a company's profit allocated to each share of stock. Imagine a pie (the company’s profit) divided into equal slices (each share of stock). The size of one slice is your EPS.

#### Formula

EPS = (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / Average Outstanding Shares

![image](https://github.com/reyou/stock-utilities-blog/assets/6571483/ba903071-2367-4358-9f4c-ebf1e53dee91)

### How to Interpret it

A higher EPS usually indicates better financial health and profitability. Keep an eye on this when picking individual stocks.

### Real-Life Example: Comparing Apple, Microsoft, and IBM

Let's delve into real-world numbers by comparing the EPS of three major tech companies: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and IBM (IBM). These numbers are hypothetical for illustrative purposes:

- **Apple (AAPL)**: EPS of $5
- **Microsoft (MSFT)**: EPS of $7
- **IBM (IBM)**: EPS of $4

#### How to Rank Them

Based on the EPS alone:
1. Microsoft (MSFT) with an EPS of $7
2. Apple (AAPL) with an EPS of $5
3. IBM (IBM) with an EPS of $4

Microsoft takes the top spot, indicating higher profitability per share, followed by Apple and then IBM. Remember, while EPS is a useful metric, it shouldn't be the sole factor in your investment decision. Always consider other financial indicators and market conditions.

## P/E Ratio

### What is it?

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is like the price tag on future earnings. It tells you how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of earnings a company generates.

![image](https://github.com/reyou/stock-utilities-blog/assets/6571483/5360edc5-3350-4eb7-b6fb-b908eab044e9)
![image](https://github.com/reyou/stock-utilities-blog/assets/6571483/c4ed588f-0d22-476e-b801-b6d7ff14b5aa)
![image](https://github.com/reyou/stock-utilities-blog/assets/6571483/5081adf6-d2a5-4867-8d08-32bd88e91da8)

#### Formula

P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)

![image](https://github.com/reyou/stock-utilities-blog/assets/6571483/04e06253-45ae-4b5c-afd1-66140e3b7c78)

### How to Interpret it

A higher P/E ratio typically indicates that investors have higher expectations for a company's future growth. Conversely, a lower P/E ratio may suggest the opposite, or that the stock is undervalued.

The P/E ratio, or price-to-earnings ratio, is calculated by dividing a company's current stock price by its earnings per share (EPS) over a specific period, usually the last 12 months.

The EPS is calculated by taking the net income of a company (earnings) and dividing it by the number of outstanding shares.

If a company has negative earnings (net loss), its EPS will be negative. However, the P/E ratio is generally not calculated or considered meaningful when the EPS is negative, because it does not provide a useful measure of valuation in this case.

So while technically a negative P/E can be calculated (by dividing the stock price by a negative EPS), it is not a meaningful or commonly used metric. A company with negative earnings will often be listed as having a "N/A" or "not applicable" P/E ratio.

#### Real-Life Example: Apple Inc.

Let's take Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an example. Let's assume the following (please note these are hypothetical numbers for illustration purposes):

- **Stock Price**: $150
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: $5

Using the formula for P/E Ratio:

```
P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)
P/E Ratio = $150 / $5
P/E Ratio = 30
```

In this example, Apple's P/E Ratio would be 30. What does that mean? Essentially, investors are willing to pay $30 for every $1 of earnings that Apple generates. A P/E Ratio of 30 often suggests that investors expect high future growth for Apple, and they are willing to pay a premium for it today.

Remember, a high P/E Ratio can indicate either that the stock is overvalued or that investors have high expectations for the company's future; the interpretation varies with the market conditions and the specific industry.

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is a commonly used metric for valuing a company. It measures the price you pay for each dollar of earnings. Here's how you might categorize P/E ratios:

1. **Low P/E Ratio (Below Industry Average):**
   - *Description:* A company with a P/E ratio lower than its industry average could be considered undervalued. However, it could also mean that the market has low expectations for the company's future earnings growth.

2. **Average P/E Ratio (Around Industry Average):**
   - *Description:* A company with a P/E ratio around its industry average might be considered fairly valued. However, the industry average P/E can vary significantly from one industry to another.

3. **High P/E Ratio (Above Industry Average):**
   - *Description:* A company with a P/E ratio higher than its industry average could be considered overvalued. However, it could also mean that the market has high expectations for the company's future earnings growth.

4. **Negative P/E Ratio:**
   - *Description:* A negative P/E ratio means the company has negative earnings (net loss). This is not a meaningful metric, as it does not provide a useful measure of valuation. A company with negative earnings will often be listed as having a "N/A" or "not applicable" P/E ratio.

5. **Zero P/E Ratio:**
   - *Description:* A zero P/E ratio means the company has zero or no earnings. Similar to a negative P/E, this is not a meaningful metric, as it does not provide a useful measure of valuation. A company with zero earnings will often be listed as having a "N/A" or "not applicable" P/E ratio.

It's important to note that while the P/E ratio is a useful tool for evaluating a company, it should not be used in isolation. Other factors, such as the company's growth prospects, financial health, and the overall market conditions, should also be considered when making investment decisions.

The industry average P/E ratio can change over time due to various factors:

1. **Earnings Changes:** If the earnings of companies in the industry change, this will affect the industry average P/E. For example, if many companies in the industry report higher earnings, this could lower the average P/E ratio.

2. **Price Changes:** Changes in the stock prices of companies in the industry will also affect the industry average P/E. If stock prices increase more than earnings, this could raise the average P/E ratio.

3. **New Companies:** The entry of new companies into the industry or the exit of existing companies can also affect the industry average P/E.

4. **Change in Industry Dynamics:** Changes in the industry dynamics, such as increased competition, regulatory changes, or technological advancements, can affect the earnings and stock prices of companies in the industry, and hence the average P/E.

Because of these and other factors, the industry average P/E can fluctuate over time, and it is essential to consider these changes when comparing a company's P/E to the industry average.

### Quick Quote

As Peter Lynch once noted, "The P/E ratio of any company that's fairly priced will equal its growth rate."

## Bonds & Bond Yields

### What is it?

A bond is like an IOU (an abbreviation of the phrase "I owe you") from the government or a corporation. When you buy a bond, you're essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value when it matures.

### How to Interpret it

Bond Yields are the interest rates on bonds. Generally, a higher yield means a riskier bond. Always consider the issuer's creditworthiness.

## Mutual Funds & ETFs

### What is it?

Think of Mutual Funds and ETFs as baskets containing multiple stocks, bonds, or other assets. They're like a pre-made salad at the supermarket: all the ingredients are already mixed in!

### How to Interpret it

Mutual Funds are actively managed, meaning professionals curate and adjust the portfolio. ETFs are usually passively managed, tracking an index or sector. Choose based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
